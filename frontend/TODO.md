# TODO: Implement Circle Follow Mouse Feature

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Create CircleFollowMouse component (frontend/src/components/CircleFollowMouse/CircleFollowMouse.tsx)
- [x] Add CSS styles for the circle (frontend/src/components/CircleFollowMouse/CircleFollowMouse.module.css)
- [x] Update GlobalLayout.tsx to import and use CircleFollowMouse
- [x] Optimize for lowest latency by removing CSS transitions
- [x] Add invert color filter for better visibility
- [x] Optimize performance using useRef to avoid re-renders
- [x] Test the feature by running the app and verifying the circle follows the mouse
